GERBING Fotoalbum exists as a foto data base since about 1997. It was used, criticized, improved and rubbed smooth so to speak by friends, 
in the circle of the family, by acquaintances and colleagues. A further distribution was not scheduled. 
At first there was hardly anyone who wanted to archive more than 10.000 fotos and find them by using a data base like me.

My starting idea was, I wanted to make it easier for me finding fotos. In our family it is tradition that with the birth of a child 
a fotoalbum is laid out where the growing up progress can be pursued. Before I had a family, there was one single fotoalbum of me. 
With the birth of the 4 children the number of the fotalbums grew rapidly, there were several fotoalbums for every child 
and there were fotoalbums for mother and father in addition. In addition there were also many fotos in envelopes and in shoe cartons 
with fotos of various grandparents and aunts. Some of the fotos were 100 years old and older. 
All fotoalbums put one behind the other were more than 1 meter wide. Now the problem frequently appeared  
that somebody could remember to a certain foto and that this foto should be looked for. But in which album was it, 
or was it even in one of the various envelopes? I have solved the problem in the year 1997 
by scanning all fotos and making up a data base program. At that time, the data base exclusively included scanned fotos.

Since digital cameras are used in the family, the problem has changed, there is not every foto on paper. 
There is the majority of the fotos only in the computer. Now is the finding over a data base still more interesting 
and there are notes of the present users now that in the internet does not exist a similar useful software. 
This was reason for me to check this assertion. I have compared the fotoalbum software offered by the market leaders Adobe and Jasc 
in the year 2004 with the result GERBING fotoalbum is better. 
And so was born the free of charge Shareware version at http://www.gerbingsoft.de

Thanks go to Timo Kunze (http://www.timosoft-software.de/) for the unicode controls since GERBING Fotoalbum 14 in the year 2013.

In January 2020 I worked intensively with software for facial recognition or automatic image recognition,
because I wanted to know whether software actually exists that automatically assigns keywords to a photo stock.
I put myself in the position of people who find it too complex to work with GERBING Fotoalbum and to assign their keywords to each individual photo.
These people want to select one or more folders and the software should examine and find out for each photo
whether it contains GPS data, whether there are faces, whether there is text and when objects occur - designate these objects.

Short answer: There is such software, but it works far too imprecisely, laziness is not rewarded. Two examples are:
Microsoft Windows 10 Photos app - doesn't need a cloud, but works very poorly.
Photos.google.com - It works pretty well, but I am bothered by the cloud constraint.

Google Picasa is software that recognizes faces and GPS data, but no text and no objects and no colors.
Google Picasa can evaluate IPTC metadata. However, this requires that the user has previously entered metadata into the photos
and that is again far too expensive for the users.
The photos may be on the local computer.

======================================================================================================

Microsoft Windows 10 Photos app can work on the local computer. Indexing a photo takes several seconds.
You can see this after adding photos to a folder. If you click in the search line, a line appears at the bottom
'Search is improved ... xx items left'. Then 'add name' appears for newly recognized faces. With 10,000 photos, it can take a whole day.
Face recognition is related to 'contacts'. There is no manual correction option.
You have to rely on the automatic detection and unfortunately it does not recognize all faces, situations cannot be recognized,
a green background will be e.g. assigned to the keyword meadow or garden or green.
There is no possibility of displaying which keywords were recognized in which photo. Such a solution is no competition for GERBING Fotoalbum.

======================================================================================================

Photos.google.com cannot work on the local computer. All photos must be uploaded to photos.google.com.
Face detection works well. You can and must help manually.
But after a while, with a lot of photos and a lot of faces, it turns into hard work.
Then i prefere to type in every name into a database line.
The GPS data is recognized.
The automatic indexing cannot recognize situations at all (when I am looking for 'party', there is only one photo, but it should be 20),
a green background becomes e.g. assigned to the keyword grass or green. It is better to formulate keywords to search in English
e.g. water or boat or food. The search works as usual with Google, e.g. snow car finds less than just snow.
There is no possibility of displaying which keywords were recognized in which photo.
In contrast to Google Picasa, no IPTC metadata is evaluated (except for caption = comments).
A few EXIF fields are adopted.
Clever users make the year and situation and location part of the name, then you can search for it.
Because of the cloud constraint and a lot of rework for facial recognition, this solution is no competition for GERBING Fotoalbum.
